Project NestBox
• Physically developed a nest-box for thick-billed parrots at Phoenix Zoo with sensors and cooling systems with the team of four people for two semesters at ASU.
• Programmed the Temperature and humidity sensors with Arduino.
• Developed a java-script interface to log and display the data collected from the nest box. 
• This interface displayed time graphs for the mass, temperature, and humidity data, and stored the collected data into a time-stamped file on the keepers’ computer for future reference at phoenix zoo.
